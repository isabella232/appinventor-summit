# Call for Workshops

The MIT App Inventor team calls for proposals for workshops at the 10th Anniversary MIT App Inventor Summit.

Potential topics for workshops may include, but are not limited to:

* Artificial Intelligence
* Internet of Things
* Robotics
* Arts & Music
* Advanced Coding Techniques in App Inventor

We will consider proposals for "half" day and "full" day workshops. Half day workshops will be 3 hours in length while full day workshops will be 5 hours in length.

Proposals should be submitted via EasyChair. Proposers must indicate the suggested length of a workshop. The organizing committee will attempt to accomodate the desired lengths where possible depending on the number and desired length of submissions accepted by the program committee.

Submissions must be submitted to EasyChair by 11:59 PM EDT, April 5th 2019. Notifications will be sent by April 26th.
