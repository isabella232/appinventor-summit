Attendees of the MIT App Inventor Summit 2019 will be able to participate for free in any of the following workshops taking place over the course of the three days of  getthe summit.

### MIT App Inventor Hackathon

*Lead by Jere Boudell, Clayton State University*

Show off your app building skills by participating in an all day hackathon with MIT App Inventor. The first part of the hackathon will include ideation and team formation. Teams will have the remainder of the first day and a portion of the second day to design and build their apps.

Hackathon teams should submit their apps by 5pm EDT on Aug 2nd so that judges will have time to review code. Teams will also present their projects to the summit participants on the morning of Aug 3rd. The hackathon winner will be announced at the closing ceremonies on Aug 3rd.

### Low Cost Health Devices and Apps

*Jointly organized by MIT App Inventor and MIT Little Devices Lab*

The MIT App Inventor and MIT Little Devices Lab teams partner to present an all-day workshop on App Inventor and IOT for medical purposes. The workshop will be divide into three parts:

1. Explore: Tour of the MIT Little Devices Lab and get an introduction to 3D printing and design
2. Build: Using 3D printed components, Arduino, and MIT App Inventor, build a <abbr title="A spirometer is a device to measure lung capacity when you breathe">spirometer</abbr> and an app to read its data
3. Hack: Brainstorm with other participants and design or prototype an app based on what you've learned!

Teams that participate in this workshop will have an opportunity to share their ideas on the last day of the summit.

Participants will need a computer and an Android enabled phone for the building and hacking portions of this activity.

### The Mobile CSP Computer Science Principles Curriculum

*Lead by Beryl Hoffman<sup>1</sup> and Pauline Lake<sup>2</sup>, <sup>1</sup>Elms College and <sup>2</sup>College of St. Scholastica*

The Mobile CS Principles (Mobile CSP) curriculum, using MIT App Inventor, is one of the NSF-supported, College Board-endorsed curricula for the new AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) course. Since 2013, the Mobile CSP project has trained more than 700 teachers, and the course has been offered to more than 20,000 students with great success on the AP exam. Mobile CSP’s goal is to provide engaging introductory high-school CS curriculum to increase students’ interest in further study and possible careers in CS, especially for those who are traditionally underrepresented in CS. Mobile CSP uses MIT App Inventor with the motto “Teach them where they live” -- on their smartphones! The curriculum engages students by encouraging them to build creative, socially-useful mobile apps that solve real-world problems in their own communities.

This half-day workshop will provide an overview of the free Mobile CSP curriculum at course.mobilecsp.org, hands-on activities using some of the curriculum material to build a Map app using the new map component in App Inventor, and pedagogical materials/tools from the teacher companion site teach.mobilecsp.org to help engage students in the classroom with an emphasis on broadening participation. Attendees will hear from experienced Mobile CSP teachers and will also be provided with information about available professional development. There will be a Q & A time for new CS teachers to interact with current Mobile CSP teachers and learn how to bring AP CSP to their schools.

This course has been used primarily at the high school level, but can also be used at the middle school or college level as a CS0 course. The target audience is middle, high school, and college instructors; high school, college, and graduate students; and anyone else interested in free curriculum! Laptop with wifi access and a Google account are required. Tablets will be provided during the activities. The online curriculum and pedagogical materials will be made available to participants under a Creative Commons license.

Agenda (3 hours):

1. Welcome: AP Mobile CSP course overview (20 minutes)
2. Sample hands-on App Inventor lesson (Map App using the new Map component) (1 hour)
3. Break (10 minutes)
4. Pedagogy and broadening participation, sample hands-on lessons (1 hour).
5. Q & A Panel: Bringing the course to your school (20 minutes)
6. Professional Development information and wrap up (10 minutes)

### How to Utilise Extensions and Connect External Hardware in App Inventor

*Lead by Queena Ling, Preface Nomad*

**Workshop Objectives**

- Allow participants to explore expanded functionality in App Inventor by extensions. e.g. handling keyboard events (keyboard input), advanced sound player, learn how to connect to other hardware within the App Inventor project
- Advocate the use of App Inventor through demonstrating the wide-ranged varieties of apps which can be created
- Empower participants to recreate their own designs using App Inventor to build projects that engages with users and community

**Workshop Overview**

Participants create their own version of a well-known game - Chrome Dinosaur which was played 270 million times globally since its launch more than 4 years ago to highlight on the “power” of App Inventor being able to recreate games of tremendous impact and extended functionalities.

**Workshop Content**

Through the App Inventor platform, participants will be able to create a replication of the famous “Chrome Dinosaur” game in which players have to control a pixelated T-Rex to jump over incoming obstacles. The workshop will also cover the use of the KeyEvent extension, enabling the game to be played with other external buttons for input besides just using touch screen. More advanced coding techniques like scrolling effects and involvement of basic physics in animations will be introduced.

**Workshop Agenda and Duration**

It is a three hour workshop that will include the following:

- Idea brainstorming and sharing in groups + pair programming
- Sharing on App Inventor Extensions: integrating extensions into projects and other examples
- Live-coding session in building codes for Dino game with participants
- Final Product Showcase and Q&A Session

**Topics Covered**

- Extensions in App Inventor
- Advanced Coding Techniques in App Inventor
- Hardware controllers as input

### A Practical Introduction to Internet of Things (IOT) Using MIT App Inventor and Micro:bit

*Lead by Natasha Kiely<sup>1</sup>, Julie Power<sup>2</sup>, and Pamela O'Brien<sup>1</sup>, <sup>1</sup>Limerick Institute of Technology and <sup>2</sup>Lero*

With the number of connected devices in use worldwide now exceeding 17 billion and the number of connected Internet of Things(IOT) devices estimated to reach 10 billion by 2020, educators and students alike have an increased awareness and appetite to explore developments and careers in this sector.

The aim of this workshop is to explore Internet of Things(IOT), the concepts, technologies and applications that are possible through the use of Mobile Applications and Micro-controllers. The workshop will take participants through a hands on experience in IOT design and development using App Inventor and Micro:Bit technologies. It will explore the needs and requirements of today’s society, looking at solving real world problems. A variety of IOT key themes will be demonstrated and developed such as Smart Health,Smart Cities, Smart Homes, Smart Cars, Smart Farming, Smart Buildings, Smart Appliances and Wearable technologies.

Participants will work in teams,collaborating through the use of shared technologies and Maker Education practices. Ideas will be shared and coded providing teachers with a wealth of knowledge, experience and practical materials that can be disseminated directly into their classrooms. Experiences will be gained and demonstrated, with workshop tutors identifying the key strengths of content delivery and indeed the pitfalls to avoid during live classroom lessons and activities. This knowledge has been acquired from experience gained by workshop facilitators in the development of IOT applications delivered to Irish educators and students across all levels of the Irish Education System.
