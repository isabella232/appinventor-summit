We are pleased to announce that this year we will be celebrating 10 years of computational education and action with MIT App Inventor! The 2019 MIT App Inventor Summit will run from August 1st-3rd at the MIT Media Lab.

App Inventor started as a project in Google Labs in 2009 and MIT has stewarded the project since 2011 under the direction of Hal Abelson, the Class of 1922 Professor of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science.

Over 8 million people use App Inventor annually and we are excited to celebrate this decade milestone with all of them.
