Unfortunately, due to the ongoing global health pandemic around COVID 19, we will not be having our MIT App Inventor Summit in 2020. In place of the summit, we are organizing a global hackathon to build App Inventor Apps for Good. We greatly regret that we have to cancel the summit and will miss discussing all of the great work people accomplish through App Inventor.
