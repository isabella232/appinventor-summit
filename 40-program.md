### The Mobile CSP Computer Science Principles Curriculum

*Lead by Beryl Hoffman<sup>1</sup> and Pauline Lake<sup>2</sup>, <sup>1</sup>Elms College and <sup>2</sup>College of St. Scholastica*

The Mobile CS Principles (Mobile CSP) curriculum, using MIT App Inventor, is one of the NSF-supported, College Board-endorsed curricula for the new AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) course. Since 2013, the Mobile CSP project has trained more than 700 teachers, and the course has been offered to more than 20,000 students with great success on the AP exam. Mobile CSP’s goal is to provide engaging introductory high-school CS curriculum to increase students’ interest in further study and possible careers in CS, especially for those who are traditionally underrepresented in CS. Mobile CSP uses MIT App Inventor with the motto “Teach them where they live” -- on their smartphones! The curriculum engages students by encouraging them to build creative, socially-useful mobile apps that solve real-world problems in their own communities.

This half-day workshop will provide an overview of the free Mobile CSP curriculum at course.mobilecsp.org, hands-on activities using some of the curriculum material to build a Map app using the new map component in App Inventor, and pedagogical materials/tools from the teacher companion site teach.mobilecsp.org to help engage students in the classroom with an emphasis on broadening participation. Attendees will hear from experienced Mobile CSP teachers and will also be provided with information about available professional development. There will be a Q & A time for new CS teachers to interact with current Mobile CSP teachers and learn how to bring AP CSP to their schools.

This course has been used primarily at the high school level, but can also be used at the middle school or college level as a CS0 course. The target audience is middle, high school, and college instructors; high school, college, and graduate students; and anyone else interested in free curriculum! Laptop with wifi access and a Google account are required. Tablets will be provided during the activities. The online curriculum and pedagogical materials will be made available to participants under a Creative Commons license.

Agenda (3 hours):

1. Welcome: AP Mobile CSP course overview (20 minutes)
2. Sample hands-on App Inventor lesson (Map App using the new Map component) (1 hour)
3. Break (10 minutes)
4. Pedagogy and broadening participation, sample hands-on lessons (1 hour).

The aim of this workshop is to explore Internet of Things(IOT), the concepts, technologies and applications that are possible through the use of Mobile Applications and Micro-controllers. The workshop will take participants through a hands on experience in IOT design and development using App Inventor and Micro:Bit technologies. It will explore the needs and requirements of today’s society, looking at solving real world problems. A variety of IOT key themes will be demonstrated and developed such as Smart Health,Smart Cities, Smart Homes, Smart Cars, Smart Farming, Smart Buildings, Smart Appliances and Wearable technologies.

Participants will work in teams,collaborating through the use of shared technologies and Maker Education practices. Ideas will be shared and coded providing teachers with a wealth of knowledge, experience and practical materials that can be disseminated directly into their classrooms. Experiences will be gained and demonstrated, with workshop tutors identifying the key strengths of content delivery and indeed the pitfalls to avoid during live classroom lessons and activities. This knowledge has been acquired from experience gained by workshop facilitators in the development of IOT applications delivered to Irish educators and students across all levels of the Irish Education System.
