              <h3 id = "poster">POSTERS</h3>
<p>Posters provide an interactive forum in which authors can present their work to attendees during poster sessions. We especially encourage students to submit their work-in-progress related to App Inventor. The poster sessions will be over lunch and coffee breaks. Posters provide an opportunity to describe new work or work that is still in progress using App Inventor.

<p> All poster submissions must have a poster overview no longer than one page. The poster overview needs to includes title, authors, and an abstract (no more than 300 words). The final version of the poster as a separate file must also be submitted. Both files must be submitted in PDF format.</p>

<p> All accepted posters will be displayed during a portion of the summit, and at least one author is requested to stand by their poster during each poster session and give interactive presentation to attendees.</p>

<p> Attendees will vote (only once) using “VoteForMe” App-Inventor app (available to be downloaded from Google Play) for their favourite poster to be awarded at the closing ceremony.</p>
<p> Please use the word or latex templates to create and submit the poster overview. The actual poster should be no bigger than A1 size to fit on poster boards. Authors can design their A1 poster as they see fit.

<p>The App Competition allows users of App Inventor to showcase their apps. In order for an app to be considered for the competition:</p>
                <ul style="padding-left:40px">
                        <li>The app must be built only using App Inventor </li>
                        <li>The app aia file needs to be submitted for testing </li>
                        <li>The app needs to be accompaned by a one page documenet containing the name of the author,
his current geographical location, the motivation behind the app and the reason for creating the app with App Inventor
</li>
                </ul>
<p>The app developer <b> DOES NOT </b> need to be present at the submit. However he/she must agree that we can showcase the app if necessary.
