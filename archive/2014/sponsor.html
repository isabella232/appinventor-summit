          <h3>Summit Sponsorship Opportunities</h3>
	<p> Each summer, the MIT App Inventor Summit brings together 250 of the vast number of MIT App Inventor to learn, share and collaborate.  Participants from all over the word share experiences around developing, refining, and promoting mobile apps using MIT App Inventor. These attendees then return to their communities to advocate for innovation in CS Education, promote the democratization of mobile app development and ultimately become local MIT App Inventor evangelists. As the flagship MIT App Inventor annual convening, all sessions are professionally video recorded and shared with the more than 1.5 million member global App Inventor community providing event sponsors with long-term brand exposure.

              <h3>ABOUT MIT APP INVENTOR</h3>
		<p> MIT App Inventor is a blocks-based programming tool that allows everyone, even novices to start programming, to build fully functional apps for Android devices. Newcomers to App Inventor can have their first app up and running in an hour or less, and can program more complex apps in significantly less time than with more traditional, text-based languages. App Inventor runs as a Web service from MIT. As of April 2014, there are 83,000 people actively using the service each week. In total there are 1.7 million registered users from 194 countries, who together have created 4.4 million apps. </p>

              <h3>Additional Sponsorship Opportunities</h3>
              <p>The MIT Center for Mobile Learning and the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab has joined with other organizations to conduct large-scale programs using App Inventor for teacher education and apps contests and challenges. One example is the national Verizon Innovative App Challenge, sponsored by the Verizon Foundation, where members of the MIT App Inventor Training Corps provide training and assistance to school team participants. Another example is the MIT Google App Inventor Summer School sponsored by Google China, which is sponsoring teacher training workshops at over a dozen Chinese universites in summer 2014, facilitated by MIT student members of the App Inventor team.</p>
              <p>Please contact <a href="mailto:mitappinventorcollaboration@mit.edu" target="_top"><b>mitappinventorcollaboration@mit.edu</b></a> if your organization is interested in
sponsoring a significant engagement with MIT around App Inventor and educational use of
mobile computing. Such engagements typically involve substantial commitment of MIT staff and resources, and investments of a few hundred thousand dollars. We also welcome you to participate with the App Inventor community on at the App Inventor Web Site or the App Inventor Forum for advice about smaller scale activities.</p>
